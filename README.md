War Thunder Emulator is a technology that allows you to share control of a tank in the game War Thunder between four crew members: commander, driver, gunner and loader. To do this, one player acts as the game's donor and has a special server installed on his PC that emulates and controls user input. The server provides a screen demo to the crew via streaming services such as Discord. Crew members can control the game through interaction with a client program on their phones. Thus, the emulator provides an unforgettable experience of teamwork to control the tank.
